# WebScrapeChallenge

In this repo, I webscraped two websites(https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_news/index.html) and (https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_facts/temperature.html). For the first url, I used beautiful soup and looped through the url to print all of the news articles available. For the second url, I used beautiful soup to extract a table from the website. I then used pandas and matplotlib to analyze the data.

To look through my code, go to files 'part_1_mars_news' and 'part_2_mars_weather'. To look at the table that I extracted, go to file 'Mars_data.csv'.
